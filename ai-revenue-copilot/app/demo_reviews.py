DEMO_REVIEWS = [
    "The food quality was absolutely outstanding. Every dish from the starters to the desserts was perfectly cooked and beautifully presented. Our guests couldn't stop complimenting the menu.",
    "We had our wedding reception here and the hall decoration was breathtaking. The team went above and beyond to make everything look magical. Highly recommended for premium events.",
    "Service was a bit slow during peak hours. We had to wait quite long for the main course to be served. The staff seemed understaffed for such a large gathering of 400 people.",
    "The venue is gorgeous and well-maintained. Air conditioning worked perfectly even with 500 guests. Parking was also very convenient with valet service available.",
    "Very disappointed with the communication. We had confirmed a specific menu two weeks before the event but some items were changed without informing us. Not acceptable at this price point.",
    "The paneer dishes were phenomenal — the best we've ever had at any banquet hall. The live cooking stations were a huge hit with our guests. Great concept!",
    "Pricing is on the higher side compared to other venues in the area, but the quality justifies the cost. You definitely get what you pay for here.",
    "Our anniversary celebration was perfect thanks to the event coordinator. She handled everything from flowers to lighting. The DJ arrangement was also top notch.",
    "The biryani was average, nothing special. Expected much better given the reputation. However, the Chinese and continental spread was excellent.",
    "Cleanliness and hygiene standards are excellent. The washrooms were well maintained even after 6 hours of the event. This is rare and appreciated.",
    "The management was very flexible with our last-minute decoration changes. They even arranged extra centerpieces at no additional cost. Very accommodating team.",
    "Sound system had issues during the sangeet ceremony. The bass was too loud and the speakers kept crackling. This needs urgent improvement.",
    "Loved the outdoor garden area for the cocktail hour. The ambient lighting created a beautiful atmosphere. Perfect for evening events and photo sessions.",
    "The dessert counter was the star of the evening. Live jalebi and gulab jamun stations were amazing. Ice cream varieties were also fantastic with 12 flavors.",
    "Had some issues with the billing. There were charges added that were not discussed initially. While they resolved it eventually, the transparency could be better.",
    "The tandoori starters were incredible — perfectly marinated and cooked. The kebab platter had great variety. Vegetarian and non-vegetarian options were both equally impressive.",
    "Unfortunately the event started 45 minutes late because the previous event was still wrapping up. This caused a lot of inconvenience for our guests who arrived on time.",
    "The staff was courteous and professional throughout the event. Every waiter was well-dressed and attentive. They even remembered special dietary requirements for some of our guests.",
    "Excellent catering for our corporate annual dinner. The buffet setup was elegant and the food was replenished promptly. Live pasta counter was a unique touch.",
    "The venue needs better signage. Multiple guests had trouble finding the right hall. The entrance could also use better lighting during evening events.",
    "We hosted a 3-day wedding function and every single day the food quality was consistent. This is very impressive for such large-scale catering over multiple days.",
    "The fruit and mocktail counter needs improvement. Options were limited and not very creative. For a premium venue, this section felt underwhelming.",
    "Photography permissions were handled smoothly. They had dedicated spots set up for couple portraits. The lighting in the main hall is naturally flattering for photos.",
    "The catering team easily handled 600+ guests without any noticeable delays. Food never ran out and quality didn't drop. Exceptional logistical management.",
    "The AC in the smaller conference room was not working properly during our day event. It got quite warm. The main hall was fine though.",
    "I've hosted events at multiple venues across the city and this ranks in the top 3 easily. The combination of food quality, service, and ambiance is hard to beat.",
    "The kids menu options were thoughtful and seemed freshly prepared rather than standard frozen items. This attention to detail for younger guests sets them apart.",
    "I wish the parking was a little bigger. For events with 500+ guests, the current lot feels cramped and some guests had to park quite far away.",
    "The thali service option for smaller gatherings was excellent value. Each thali had 12+ items and the quantity was generous. Perfect for intimate family functions.",
    "The events team proactively shared a detailed timeline and floor plan before our event. This level of preparation made us feel confident everything would go smoothly. And it did."
